- TTL ~ 100ms
- First load JS ~ 79kb
- Lighthouse score of 100 (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- State management with XState and Zustand
- Advanced animation support with GSAP

This starter allows you to navigate seamlessly between pages with dynamic dom and/or canvas content without reloading or creating a new canvas every time. 3D components are usable anywhere in the dom. The events, dom, viewport, everything is synchronized!

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

The project follows a modern architecture with several key components:

1. **Frontend (Next.js + React Three Fiber)**
   - App directory structure
   - Canvas-based 3D rendering
   - Real-time WebSocket communication
   - State management with XState and Zustand

2. **Backend (Express + WebSocket)**
   - Express server for API endpoints
   - WebSocket server for real-time communication
   - Processing.js integration

3. **3D Components**
   - Uses tunnel-rat for portal components between renderers
   - GLSL shader support
   - Advanced animation capabilities with GSAP

```jsx
<div className='relative'>
  <View orbit className='relative sm:h-48 sm:w-full'>
    <Dog scale={2} />
    // Some 3D components will be rendered here
  </View>
</div>
```

### :control_knobs: Available Scripts
